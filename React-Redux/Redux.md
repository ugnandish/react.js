  <h2>What Is Redux?</h2>
  <p>Redux is also a library which is used widely for front-end development.<br/>It is basically a tool for managing both data-state and UI-state in JavaScript applications. Redux separates the application data and business logic into its own container in order to let React manage just the view.</p>

  <h2>Why Redux With React?</h2>
  <p>React follows the component-based approach, where the data flows through the components.</p>
  <p>The data in React always flows from parent to child components which makes it unidirectional. <br/>This surely keeps our data organized and helps us in controlling the    application better.</p>
  <p>The application’s state is contained in specific stores and as a result, the rest of the components remain loosely coupled.<br/>This makes our application more flexible   leading to increased efficiency. That’s why communication from a parent component to a child component is convenient.</p>
  <p>But what happens when we try to communicate from a non-parent component?</p>
  <p>A child component can never pass data back up to the parent component. React does not provide any way for direct component-to-component communication.
  <br/>Even though React has   features to support this approach, it is considered to be a poor practice.</p>
