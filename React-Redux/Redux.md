  <h2>Why Redux With React?</h2>
  <p>React follows the component-based approach, where the data flows through the components.</p>
  <p>The data in React always flows from parent to child components which makes it unidirectional. <br/>This surely keeps our data organized and helps us in controlling the application better.</p>
  <p>the application’s state is contained in specific stores and as a result, the rest of the components remain loosely coupled.<br/>This makes our application more flexible leading to increased efficiency. That’s why communication from a parent component to a child component is convenient.</p>
