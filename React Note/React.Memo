<h1>React.Memo</h1>
<h2>Memoization in React</h2>
<p>In React functional components, when props within a component change, the entire component re-renders by default.<br/>In other words, if any value within a component updates, the entire components will re-render, including functions/components that have not had their values/props altered.
