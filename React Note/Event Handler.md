<h1>Event Handlers</h1>
<p>Event handlers determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired. This could be a button click or a change in a text input. Essentially, event handlers are what make it possible for users to interact with your application.</p>
<p>Handling events with react elements is similar to handling events on DOM elements, with a few minor exceptions.</p>
