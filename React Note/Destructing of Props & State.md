    <li>Destructuring is a characteristic of Javascript, It is used to take out sections of data from an array or objects, we can assign them to new own variables created by the developer</li>
    <li>In destructuring, It does not change an array or any object, it makes a copy of the desired object or array element by assigning them in its own new variables, later we can use this new variable in React (class & functional) components</li>
