  <h1>Destructuring of Props & State</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Destructuring is a characteristic of Javascript, It is used to take out sections of data from an array or objects, we can assign them to new own variables created by the developer</li>
    <li>In destructuring, It does not change an array or any object, it makes a copy of the desired object or array element by assigning them in its own new variables, later we can use this new variable in React (class & functional) components</li>
    <li>It makes the code more clear. when we access the props using <strong>this</strong> keywords, we have to use <strong>this/this.props</strong> throughtout the program, but by the use of restructuring, we can discard <strong>this/this.props</strong> by assigning them in new variables</li>
    <li>This is very difficult to monitor props in complex applications, so by assigning these props in new own variables we can make a code more readable</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages of Destructuring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It makes developer's life easy, by assigning their own variables</li>
    <li>Nested data is more complex, it takes time to access, but by the use of destructuring, we can access faster of nested data</li>
    <li>It improves the sustainability, readability of code</li>
    <li>It helps to cut the amount of code used in an application</li>
    <li>It trims the number of steps taken to access data properties</li>
    <li>It provides components with the exact data properties</li>
    <li>It serves time from iterate over an array of objects multiple times</li>
    <li>In Reactjs we use multiple times ternary operators inside the render function, without destructuring it looks complex & hard to access them, but by the use of destructuring, we can improve the readability of ternary operators.</li>
  </ul>
