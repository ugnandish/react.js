    <div>
    <h2>Memoization in React</h2>
    <p>In React functional components, when props within a component change, the entire component re-renders by default.
      <br/>In other words, if any value within a component updates, the entire components will re-render, including functions/components that have not had their values/props altered.
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>React.Memo()</b> is a higher-order component that we can use to wrap components that we do not want to re-render unless props within them change</p>
